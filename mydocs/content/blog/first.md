I've decided to start a blog. I plan to write about mathematics, data science, data engineering, and whatever else I want to write about. There are two types of posts on this site: blogs and docs. Blog posts are about thoughts and ideas, while documentation are brief, clear explanatory posts about a particular topic. I write articles in English and Japanese. I hope you enjoy my blog posts.
